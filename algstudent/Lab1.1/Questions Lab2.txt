Years of counting: 14 years
Meaning time measured to 0:
Size of problem we get reliable times: 50000
Multiplied by 2: We have to wait twice as much iterations to get a time that isn't 0 milliseconds
Multiplication value changed: The iterations we have to wait to get to a time that isn't 0 milliseconds is lower
Times for O(n): Yes, because
